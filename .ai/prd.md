# The Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Physia

## 1. Product overview
The purpose of Project Physia is to enable users with overload-related muscle pain to quickly
create a personalized exercise plan based on the selected body part and the intensity of the pain selected by user.
The exercise database was originally developed by a licensed physiotherapist. It includes detailed exercise descriptions and accompanying images,  muscle pain assessment tests linked to specific 4 body parts (Neck and upper back, Lower back, Wrists and forearms, Hips and Knees). Final excercises session plan is generated by AI that combines user input and data base knowledge and enrich the response with its own input.

## 2.User problem
Difficulties with access to physiotherapists. Dealing with overload-related muscle pain requires
many visits and needs modifications depending on intensity.

## 3. Functional requirements
1. Body area selection and session generation:
   - Mandatory medical disclaimer before first session.
   - After accepting the disclaimer, the user selects one of the four body areas affected by muscle strain pain (Neck and upper back, Lower back, Wrists and forearms, Hips and Knees).
   - The application displays up to three muscle tests associated with the selected body area.
   - The user sets pain intensity for each muscle test using a slider (scale 1–10).
   - After clicking Submit, the application sends data to the LLM API.
   - The LLM model generates a personalized training session plan based on: the user's input (selected body area and pain intensity for each muscle test), the physiotherapist-curated exercise database, and the LLM's own domain knowledge.

2. Session history view:
   - A "My Sessions" list view showing all previously generated training sessions for the authenticated user.
   - Each session can be expanded to view detailed exercises and feedback.

3. Basic authentication and user accounts system:
   - Registration and login.
   - Ability to delete the account and associated medical data upon request.

4. Data storage and scalability:
   - The database will include:
     - Physiotherapist-curated entities: body_parts, muscle_tests, exercises (with exercise_images), medical_disclaimers.
     - User-generated data: sessions (selected body area and pain_intensities per test), generated_sessions (AI-enriched training plans), feedback_ratings.
   - All data stored securely and in a manner ensuring scalability and compliance with privacy regulations.

5. Exercise Feedback Statistics:
   - Collecting information on how many exercises were rated positively (thumbs up/down feedback system after each session).

6. Legal requirements and constraints:
   - User personal data and their health data stored in compliance with GDPR.
   - Right to access and delete data (account along with data) upon user request.

## 4. Product Boundaries
1. Out of MVP scope:
   - Does not replace medical consultation.
   - Advanced, custom algorithm for creating and modifying exercises (we use pre-prepared data and LLM excercises adjustments).
   - Gamification mechanisms.
   - Mobile applications (currently web version only).
   - Import of multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
   - Publicly available API.
   - Extensive notification system.

## 5. User Stories

### US-001: Body area selection
**Description**: As an office worker, I want to select a maximum of 1 body area so that I can focus on the painful region.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System blocks a second selection with the message "Select max 1 area".
- Icons change color upon selection (grey → blue).

### US-002: Pain intensity assessment and session generation
**Description**: As a user, I want to rate the pain for each muscle test on a scale of 1–10 and click Submit so that the AI can generate a personalized training session.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Up to three muscle tests displayed for the selected body area.
- A slider allows rating each muscle test from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain prevents work).
- Upon clicking Submit, the system calls the LLM API and displays the generated training session plan.

### US-003: Feedback system
**Description**: As a product owner, I want to collect satisfaction ratings.
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Thumb up/ Thumb down" buttons to rate generated session.

### US-004: Medical safety
